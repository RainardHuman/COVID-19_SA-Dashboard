# User Interface Translations

We need your help to get more translation for our user interface. You can contribute by following the following instructions:

1. Download [english user interface json](https://github.com/coenraadhuman/COVID-19_SA-Dashboard/raw/develop/src/assets/i18n/en.json), this will be used as a template for your translation.
1. Translate downloaded json by changing the key values to your translated values.
1. Change the name of your edited json to an applicable 
ISO 639-2 code, use the following a [reference](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). Example: ```eng.json -> afr.json (Afrikaans ISO 639-2 code)```.
1. Fork our [project](https://github.com/coenraadhuman/COVID-19_SA-Dashboard) on GitHub.
1. On your forked version of the project, just upload your new json file (GitHub interface provides this functionality) on the following page: ```https://github.com/{ CHANGE TO YOUR USERNAME }/COVID-19_SA-Dashboard/tree/develop/src/assets/i18n```.
1. Finally, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your forked version of the project's develop branch to our project's develop branch. ```Please include in the pull request message the language translation you have contributed```.
